Notepad++ is a free (free as in both "free speech" and "free beer") source code
editor and Notepad replacement that supports several programming languages and
natural languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by
[GPL License](LICENSE).

Based on the powerful editing component [Scintilla](https://www.scintilla.org/), Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.
